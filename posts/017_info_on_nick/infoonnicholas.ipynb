    "This was an interesting conversation. I did not think ChatGPT was going to respond with such reservation. If you look up my name on Google, you can immediately find my LinkedIn. You can also find general information, like the high school I went to, and even some clubs I am involved in at Penn. It was shocking to see ChatGPT not even offer this very accessible information. However, it is good to see that AI has a strong sense of privacy concerns and will not offer up someone else's private information. "
