    "Discussions about the growth of AI are strongly political. I foresee the development of AI being a contentious topic in America's political climate in the upcoming months and years. So, I decided to ask Google: Gemini 2.5 Flash's political affiliation and try to break through its expected denial of political affiliation. Here is how my conversation with the AI went:"

    "When people evaluate candidates, they often consider a wide range of factors, which can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Policy Positions:** Their stances on issues like the economy, healthcare, education, foreign policy, environment, social justice, etc.\n",
    "*   **Experience:** Their past political roles, professional background, or leadership experience.\n",
    "*   **Leadership Style:** How they communicate, make decisions, and interact with others.\n",
    "*   **Character and Integrity:** Perceptions of their honesty, trustworthiness, and ethical conduct.\n",

    "This conversation went as expected. I did not think the AI would say what its political affiliation was, if it even had one. I was even more shocked to see that it would not even pick a color it liked. I assume it did not pick because I just asked for its political affiliation, and blue and red are associated with the two largest political parties in the United States. It was also interesting to see that when I asked the AI model to respond in one word, it simply said \"cannot\" instead of stating a candidate. "
