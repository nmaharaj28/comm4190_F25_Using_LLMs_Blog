    "A growing TikTok trend has emerged, where creators are giving AI some of their pictures and asking it to recreate the image in a crayon drawing. I found this interesting, since people are quick to criticize the use of AI for creating art, but this trend has escaped this criticism. Today, I gave AI one of my favorite pictures--my brother, cousins, and myself with my grandparents--to see if AI could recreate the image using a crayon-based art style. "

    "This was an interesting response. It is easy to tell that this \"drawing\" was not completed by a child, and the coloring in the drawing does not look natural; the strokes look the same, giving the drawing a digital look. The arms and noses are also weird. However, I am impressed by ChatGPT's ability to create new drawings in the background. the cloud, sun, and fence were not in the original picture; rather, ChatGPT created it. "
