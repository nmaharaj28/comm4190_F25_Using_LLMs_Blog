    "This was a fun prompt for AI. It prompts me to think about whether Lego engineers and designers are going to begin using AI to create their products. I also begin to wonder if some Lego designers have their jobs in jeopardy due to AI's ability to turn pictures into Lego designs. The picture that ChatGPT gave me was fairly accurate. ChatGPT even went the extra mile and turned the boat in the picture into Legos, too. Something inaccurate about the photo AI gave me is that the right sleeve color should be tan, not green. However, ChatGPT gave an impressive recreation of the photo into Lego, furthering the debate and fear about AI's role in creative design and art. "
