    "I can help guide you through the process of registering for classes at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), but I can't access registration systems or enroll you directly. Here's how you can get started registering for Spring 2026 classes at Penn:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Check Registration Dates**\n",
    "- Go to Penn's Office of the University Registrar website: [https://www.upenn.edu/registrar/](https://www.upenn.edu/registrar/)\n",
    "- Look for the \"Academic Calendar\" or \"Course Registration\" section to find the Spring 2026 registration timeline.\n",
    "- Note key dates: advance registration, course selection period, and add/drop deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Log in to Path@Penn**\n",
    "- Path@Penn is the student portal where you can search for courses, plan your schedule, and register: [https://path.at.upenn.edu](https://path.at.upenn.edu)\n",
    "- Log in using your PennKey and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Meet with Your Academic Advisor**\n",
    "- Schedule an advising appointment if required by your school/major.\n",
    "- Review degree requirements and get approval if necessary for certain classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Search for Courses**\n",
    "- Use the Course Search tool in Path@Penn to browse Spring 2026 offerings.\n",
    "- Use filters like subject, time, instructor, level, or sector requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Add Courses to Your Cart**\n",
    "- You can create a preliminary schedule by adding courses to your cart.\n",
    "- Check for prerequisites and time conflicts.\n",
    "- Some schools or majors may have preferred course selection procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Register During Advance or Open Registration**\n",
    "- During your assigned time, go to Path@Penn and officially register for your desired courses.\n",
    "- Be ready with backup options in case classes are full.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Monitor for Waitlists and Changes**\n",
    "- If you're on a waitlist, regularly check your email and Path@Penn for updates.\n",

    "I am impressed with ChatGPT here! It gave me a very thorough overview and advice for registering for Penn classes. It gave me very good classes to register for. It was able to identify classes that double-counted for different requirements, and it knew which classes would count for which degree. However, the course codes it offered were completely wrong. ChatGPT also generated classes that are not offered next semester, or I at least could not find them on the Path@Penn website. I would not use ChatGPT to help me register for classes in the future, though, since it did have this flaw. "
