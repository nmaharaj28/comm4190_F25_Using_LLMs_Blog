    "This was interesting! The AI was able to give suggestions to cure my bordem, which ultimately led to us playing 20 question. It was interesting to see how the AI maintained clear rules and kept track of my remaining questions, which helped me stay organized. I noticed how it gave encouraging responses after each of my questions, using phrases like \"you're getting warmer!\" and \"you're making good progress!\" which made AI feel more human. It didn't just give yes/no answers but kept the conversation flowing naturally. I also appreciated how it recapped my strategy at the end, showing how I narrowed down the possibilities step by step."
