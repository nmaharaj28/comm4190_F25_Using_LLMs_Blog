    "This was fun to read! ChatGPT had a very accurate itenrary of Bayonne. All the parks and restruants that were listed are real and popular places in Bayonne. I noticed that it even explained how to walk the Bayonne Bridge without technically leaving Bayonne, which shows how it paid close attention to the rules I set. I was also surprised by how thorough the itinerary was. It didn’t just list a few spots but created a full day with meals, parks, and cultural stops, and even an optional second day. It even added practical notes about hours, closures, links, reviews, and reservations. It reflects how thorough and smart AI is. This is a useful tool that a lot of people can use. "
