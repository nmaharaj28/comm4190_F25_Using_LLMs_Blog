For example, I asked the AI to tell me about the Penn student experience. Today, I decided to aks ChatGPT what its favorite color and animal was to learn more about the AI and simulate small talk."

    "This was a very simple conversation. It was interesting to see how ChatGPT would not answer the question, initally saying that it does not have a favorite color. I was shocked to see that it was able to assess itself and pick a color based on what the AI thought of itself. It shows that ChatGPT has a level of self-awareness. It was also interesting to see ChatGPT give me a color match based on the little information it knew about me. I would say the assessemnt is inaccruate because I am not analytical or bold, nor is purple my favorite color. When asked what its favorite animal was, it also decided to self-assess and base the answer on a reflection. I wonder if ChatGPT's answer is different depending on how people use the LLM. Since I previously asked ChatGPT to answer the meaning of life, I think that's why it answered with reflective. "
