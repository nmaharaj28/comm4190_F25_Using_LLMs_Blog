    "Throughout my marketing classes, I often use AI to generate images for my case studies and projects (by instruction of my professors). During my final project for Consumer Behavior, my group needed to use AI to create mockup images of our brand suggestions for Chuck e Cheese. However, when we asked AI for help, it often told us it could not create pictures since Chuck e Cheese is under copyright, so creating images revolving Chuck e Cheese characters goes against ChatGPT's guidelines. I decided to explore this further by asking ChatGPT to create a superhero, but my description was identical to Superman. "

    "This was a very interesting interaction with AI. Firstly, AI did not generate the picture of the superhero. It was stricking to see that AI has enough knowledge to detect that my description of a superhero was Superman despite not saying specific names. The rest of the conversation was bizzare. It seems I encountered some glitch in the LLM. When I asked AI to generate an image of a different superhero, it still claimed the request violated guidelines. ChatGPT kept claiming that it was generating an image of a new and unique superhero, but that was not happening. I wonder if the request was still violating guidelines so ChatGPT could not generate an image or the LLM was simply glitching and could not generate the image at the moment. Regardless, it was interesting to see how confident ChatGPT was in claiming it was providing me an image of a new superhero, despite nothing happening."
