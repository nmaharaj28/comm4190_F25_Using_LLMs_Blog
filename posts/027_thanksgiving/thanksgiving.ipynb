    "I remember during the COVID-19 pandemic, a TikTok mom would post dinner recipes using the grocery section of Dollar Tree. I thought this was cool since it helped provide low-income families with fun recipes. With one of my previous blog posts revealing that AI can generate grocery lists and recipes, I decided to ask Gemini if it could create a Thanksgiving menu only using Dollar Tree items. "

    "    *   1 cup All-Purpose Flour\n",

    "    *   1/4 cup Vegetable Oil (or shortening, chilled if possible)\n",

    "    *   2 cans Apple Slices (drained *very* well)\n",
    "    *   1/4 cup Granulated Sugar (adjust to taste, as canned apples are often sweet)\n",
    "    *   1 teaspoon Ground Cinnamon\n",
    "    *   Pinch of Ground Nutmeg (optional)\n",
    "    *   1 teaspoon Lemon Juice\n",
    "    *   1 tablespoon All-Purpose Flour (as a thickener)\n",

    "    *   1 tablespoon water or a splash of powdered milk mixed with water\n",
    "    *   1 teaspoon Granulated Sugar\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Make the Pie Dough:**\n",
    "    *   In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.\n",
    "    *   Pour in the vegetable oil. Use a fork or your fingers to mix until it resembles coarse crumbs.\n",
    "    *   Gradually add the ice cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overmix.\n",
    "    *   Form the dough into a ball, flatten slightly, wrap (if you have plastic wrap or a baggie), and chill in the fridge for at least 15 minutes if possible (this makes it easier to roll).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Prepare the Apple Filling:**\n",
    "    *   While the dough chills, drain the canned apple slices *very* well. Pat them dry with paper towels if you have them.\n",
    "    *   In a bowl, gently mix the drained apple slices with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg (if using), lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of flour. The flour helps thicken the filling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Assemble the Hand Pies:**\n",
    "    *   Lightly flour a clean counter or cutting board.\n",
    "    *   Roll out the chilled dough into a thin circle (about 1/8 inch thick).\n",
    "    *   Using a knife or a round cookie cutter (or even the rim of a can), cut out 4-6 circles (about 4-5 inches in diameter). You may need to re-roll scraps.\n",
    "    *   Place a spoonful of the apple filling on one half of each dough circle, leaving a small border.\n",
    "    *   Fold the other half of the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape.\n",
    "    *   Press the edges firmly with your fingers, then crimp with a fork to seal completely.\n",
    "    *   Cut a few small slits on top of each hand pie for steam to escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Bake the Hand Pies:**\n",
    "    *   Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n",
    "    *   If you have a small baking sheet, lightly grease it or line it with foil.\n",
    "    *   Brush the tops of the hand pies with a little water (or the powdered milk/water mixture) and sprinkle with a pinch of sugar (this helps them brown and get a nice crust).\n",
    "    *   Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.\n",
    "    *   Let them cool slightly before serving. They are delicious warm!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Success with Dollar Tree Pie:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Rolling Pin Substitute:** If you don't have a rolling pin, a clean, sturdy bottle (like a soda bottle) or a clean, unopened can will work in a pinch!\n",
    "*   **Small Baking Dish:** If you don't want to do hand pies, you could press the dough into a small oven-safe dish (like a ramekin or a small foil pan if available) for a rustic \"apple tart.\" Just make sure to vent the top.\n",
    "*   **Don't Overwork the Dough:** For a tender crust, mix the dough just until it comes together.\n",

    "This was a fun conversation with Gemini. It was able to create an entire Thanksgiving menu for two, including desserts and side dishes. \n",
    "Gemini stayed consistent with Dollar Tree items. The menu was also creative, since Gemini offered substitutions like the creamy chicken bake and green bean casserole. I wanted to see what else Gemini could create, so I asked Gemini to create an apple pie recipe. This recipe did not follow the Dollar Tree restrictions, however, since most Dollar Tree's do not carry flour, sugar, etc. Overall, Gemini proved to be a clever tool that can provide low-income families with fun recipes for the holidays.
