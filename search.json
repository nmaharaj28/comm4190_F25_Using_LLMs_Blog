    "text": "I asked ChatGBT is if it can tell me a joke, because I wanted to test to see if AI can make me laugh. I was curious to see if AI is creative enough to tell jokes.\nHere is how my conversation with ChatGBT went:\nTell me a joke to make me laugh\nSure thingâ€”hereâ€™s one for you:\nWhy donâ€™t graveyards ever get overcrowded?\nBecause people are dying to get in. ðŸª¦ðŸ˜…\nWant me to go darker, more clever, or just plain silly with the next one?\nDo a plain silly one\nAlright, hereâ€™s a plain silly one:\nWhy canâ€™t you trust stairs?\nBecause theyâ€™re always up to something! ðŸ˜†\nWant me to throw in a punny one next?\n\nThis conversation was very interesting, even though it was minimal. I was shocked to see how ChatGPT used dark humor and joked about cemeteries. I also thought the interaction would be more similar to a conversation, where ChatGPT would give me a chance to answer the initial question instead of immediately telling me the answer. It felt like ChatGPT was simply giving me an example of a joke, instead of interacting with me. I also found it interesting how ChatGPT used emojis. It made the interaction seem friendly and even silly, which matches the prompt of asking for a joke. Finally, ChatGPT told me it can provide me with different jokes of different genres, which kept me engaged with AI longer than I expected. Overall, though, I did not find the jokes funny, so it failed in making me laugh."
