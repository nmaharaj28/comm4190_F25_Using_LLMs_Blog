    "text": "A growing TikTok trend has emerged, where creators are giving AI some of their pictures and asking it to recreate the image in a crayon drawing. I found this interesting, since people are quick to criticize the use of AI for creating art, but this trend has escaped this criticism. Today, I gave AI one of my favorite pictures‚Äìmy brother, cousins, and myself with my grandparents‚Äìto see if AI could recreate the image using a crayon-based art style.\nHere is how my conversation with ChatGBT went:\nCreate a whimsical crayon drawing based on this picture loose, wobbly lines and exaggerated shapes. Use a cartoon drawing stye so the image looks like a drawing from crayon. Use waxy textures on white paper and keep the background simple and childlike.\n\nChatGBT responded with this picture:\n\nThis was an interesting response. It is easy to tell that this ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù was not completed by a child, and the coloring in the drawing does not look natural; the strokes look the same, giving the drawing a digital look. The arms and noses are also weird. However, I am impressed by ChatGPT‚Äôs ability to create new drawings in the background. the cloud, sun, and fence were not in the original picture; rather, ChatGPT created it."

    "text": "I asked ChatGBT is if it can tell me a joke, because I wanted to test to see if AI can make me laugh. I was curious to see if AI is creative enough to tell jokes.\nHere is how my conversation with ChatGBT went:\nTell me a joke to make me laugh\nSure thing‚Äîhere‚Äôs one for you:\nWhy don‚Äôt graveyards ever get overcrowded?\nBecause people are dying to get in. ü™¶üòÖ\nWant me to go darker, more clever, or just plain silly with the next one?\nDo a plain silly one\nAlright, here‚Äôs a plain silly one:\nWhy can‚Äôt you trust stairs?\nBecause they‚Äôre always up to something! üòÜ\nWant me to throw in a punny one next?\n\nThis conversation was very interesting, even though it was minimal. I was shocked to see how ChatGPT used dark humor and joked about cemeteries. I also thought the interaction would be more similar to a conversation, where ChatGPT would give me a chance to answer the initial question instead of immediately telling me the answer. It felt like ChatGPT was simply giving me an example of a joke, instead of interacting with me. I also found it interesting how ChatGPT used emojis. It made the interaction seem friendly and even silly, which matches the prompt of asking for a joke. Finally, ChatGPT told me it can provide me with different jokes of different genres, which kept me engaged with AI longer than I expected. Overall, though, I did not find the jokes funny, so it failed in making me laugh."

    "text": "I try to play the New York Times game every so often, but I struggle with playing the game Connections, where you group words together based on your guessed category. Connections has also gone viral on social media, with people discussing how challenging the game can become. This inspired me to see if artificial intelligence can think critically enough to help me solve Connections.\nThis is how my conversation with ChatGPT went:\nCan you help me solve today‚Äôs connection puzzle\n\nNice puzzle ‚Äî got it!\nGroup 1 ‚Äî things with a shell EGG, SNAIL, HARD TACO, M&M (eggshell, snail shell, taco shell, candy shell)\nGroup 2 ‚Äî types of dog BULL, WATCH, UNDER, LAP (bulldog, watchdog, underdog, lapdog)\nGroup 3 ‚Äî words meaning finished COMPLETE, DONE, OVER, THROUGH\nGroup 4 ‚Äî ways to drink quickly / take a drink SLUG, GULP, BELT, SHOT\nWant me to explain any of the connections in more detail?\nI then entered these answer choices into the puzzle to determine if they were correct. They were!\n\nThis was an interesting interaction with ChatGPT. The LLM did not explain its thinking behind the answer choices, which is what I was initially looking for. I wanted the interaction to be more based on hints and clues, rather than just the answers. I wanted AI to help me solve the puzzle instead of just solving it for me. It was also interesting to see the order in which AI solved the puzzle. Most people try to find the categories in the order of yellow, green, blue, and then purple, since that is the order of difficulty. So, it was interesting to see AI correctly guess the hardest category on its second answer choice."

As a big fan of Lego, I asked ChatGPT to create a Lego minifigure based on a picture of myself.\nHere is how my conversation with ChatGBT went:\nTurn me into a Lego minifigure\n\nChatGBT responded with this picture:\n\nThis was a fun prompt for AI. It prompts me to think about whether Lego engineers and designers are going to begin using AI to create their products. I also begin to wonder if some Lego designers have their jobs in jeopardy due to AI‚Äôs ability to turn pictures into Lego designs. The picture that ChatGPT gave me was fairly accurate. ChatGPT even went the extra mile and turned the boat in the picture into Legos, too. Something inaccurate about the photo AI gave me is that the right sleeve color should be tan, not green. However, ChatGPT gave an impressive recreation of the photo into Lego, furthering the debate and fear about AI‚Äôs role in creative design and art.\n\n![](aipic.png)\n\n/bin/bash: -c: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `aipic.png'\n/bin/bash: -c: line 1: `[](aipic.png)'"
